    <h2>Is teamwork a skill?</h2>

Regardless of whether you communicate in person, via email, phone and instant messages, good communications skills help you share relevant ideas, thoughts and key information with other team members. Effective communication relies on factors such as listening actively, asking questions when required, showing respect, being friendly and maintaining good body language.</p>
    <h3>Conflict management =></h3>
    <p>A critical teamwork skill is the ability to mediate conflicts between team members. Employers prefer candidates with strong conflict management skills because such employees can handle conflicts with efficiency and fairness. When resolving conflicts, an efficient team player will try to reduce workplace tension and foster communication between the conflicting team members to improve the team's productivity.</p>
    <h3>Active listening =></h3>
    <p>Active listening skills help team members to trust and understand each other. The ability to listen to your team members can help you understand what they are trying to communicate. When you focus intently on someone as they share their ideas, thoughts or feelings, it shows them that you care about their viewpoint.</p>
    <h3>Responsibility =></h3>
    <p>Within the dynamic of teamwork, it is important that the parties involved both understand the work they are responsible for and make the effort to complete said tasks on time and up to the expected standard. With the entire team functioning properly by taking responsibility for their own work, they can work together towards a common goal.</p>
